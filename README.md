# Realtime Chat Application

This repository contains the code for a full Realtime Chat Application. The application is built using React for the front end and utilizes NodeJS along with the Socket.io library for handling web sockets on the back end.

You will gain a solid understanding of how to implement real-time communication between clients using web sockets and Socket.io, which can be applied to create various types of real-time applications. 

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start both the client and server development servers by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the development servers for both the client and server, allowing you to run and test the Chat Application locally.

## Usage

Once the development servers are running, you can access the Chat Application in your web browser. The application will provide a user interface for sending and receiving messages in real time.
